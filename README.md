## 📚 What I Learned Building This Project

This project taught me valuable skills in full-stack web development:

### **Backend & APIs**

- ✅ Building RESTful APIs with Next.js 15 App Router
- ✅ Server-side authentication with NextAuth.js (Credentials + OAuth)
- ✅ MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM
- ✅ File uploads to cloud storage (Cloudinary)
- ✅ API error handling and validation
- ✅ Environment variable management for security

### **Frontend & UI/UX**

- ✅ React Server Components (RSC) and Client Components
- ✅ TypeScript for type-safe development
- ✅ TailwindCSS for responsive design
- ✅ Dark mode implementation with next-themes
- ✅ Context API for global state management
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware

### **Web Accessibility**

- ✅ Running accessibility audits with Axe-core
- ✅ Understanding WCAG compliance levels
- ✅ Parsing and displaying accessibility violations
- ✅ Identifying critical vs. minor issues

### **DevOps & Deployment**

- ✅ Dockerizing a Next.js application for production deployment
- ✅ Deploying the application on Render using Docker
- ✅ Configuring environment variables and runtime settings on Render
- ✅ Integrating Browserless.io for reliable remote browser-based scanning
- ✅ Managing deployment secrets and API keys securely in hosted environments

### **Tools & Libraries**

- ✅ Puppeteer for browser automation
- ✅ Axe-core for accessibility testing
- ✅ NextAuth for authentication
- ✅ Hot Toast for notifications
- ✅ Git version control

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Cloudinary account
- Google OAuth credentials (optional)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/axeon.git
    cd axeon

    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create `.env.local`

Use the exact variable names below (matching current code):

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# NextAuth
NEXT_AUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# Google OAuth (optional if you only use credentials)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLIENT_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Accessibility scan runtime
# Recommended for production/serverless
BROWSERLESS_TOKEN=your_browserless_token

# Optional: override Chrome binary path for scan worker
# CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/chrome
```

Notes:

- In production, scanning requires either `BROWSERLESS_TOKEN` or `CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
- On local Windows development, the scan route tries to use local Chrome at `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe` unless overridden.

### 3. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## NPM Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
```

## Scan API Example

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

### Successful response shape

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "scannedAt": "2026-03-15T00:00:00.000Z",
    "totalIssues": 3,
    "issuesBySeverity": {
        "high": 2,
        "medium": 1,
        "low": 0
    },
    "issues": [
        {
            "id": "abc123xyz",
            "category": "Accessibility",
            "name": "Issue title",
            "description": "Issue details",
            "severity": "High",
            "affectedElements": ["<img ...>"],
            "remediation": "How to fix"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deployment Notes

- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `vercel.json` are included.
- For serverless deployments, Browserless is the expected runtime strategy for scanning.
